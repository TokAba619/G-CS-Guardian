      <h2>8A. Security and Compliance Alignment</h2>
      <p>
        We follow recognized cybersecurity and privacy frameworks to protect user data, although CS-Guardian is not currently certified.
        Our practices are guided by the following standards and frameworks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA)</strong> ‚Äî We handle all personal data according to Malaysian privacy requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002 (Guidance)</strong> ‚Äî We apply best practices in access control, encryption, and incident management.</li>
        <li><strong>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)</strong> ‚Äî Our operations align with the Identify‚ÄìProtect‚ÄìDetect‚ÄìRespond‚ÄìRecover model.</li>
        <li><strong>OWASP Application Security Practices</strong> ‚Äî We follow secure coding and testing methods to reduce common vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Google API Services User Data Policy (Limited Use)</strong> ‚Äî OAuth data is used only for the purpose of performing authorized scans and is never sold or shared.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Key measures include encryption in transit and at rest, least-privilege access control, audit logging, vulnerability
        management, and an internal incident response plan. If we obtain formal certifications in the future (ISO/IEC 27001),
        we will update this Policy accordingly.
